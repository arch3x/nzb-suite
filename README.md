# docker-nzb-suite

Ever wanted to setup a complete environment that does the following
* Downloads NZB files
* Searches for new episodes of your favourite show and downloads them when they appear
* Search for new movies and downloads them when they appear
* Add subtitles to your Movies and TV shows
* Combine multiple newzbin search providers into one simple interface
* Use Spotweb as an alternative newzbin provider

All you need is
1. A running docker environment
2. A usenet provider
3. A MySQL database (add this to the compose file and change parameters)

Get the *docker-compose.yml* file and modify the parameters to your liking

Usage:
```docker-compose up -d```
